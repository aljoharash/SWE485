**Project Motivation:**

We decided to choose this topic for our project as the idea interested us and the dataset was very detailed and thorough. It provided a lot of information about many different fastfood options and their nutritional value, which will benefit us greatly when we start analysing the data for our project. This topic is also something we are familiar with so we wonâ€™t face any challenges in regards to understanding the data.

Our motivation for this project is to be able to fully grasp what we learned about machine learning in our lectures. We hope to gain a better understanding of the techniques we learned by determining which one would be the best for our dataset and applying these techniques ourselves onto this dataset. We hope that by the end of this project, we will have fully understood the concepts of machine learning and it's techniques.
